I wanted a Buster Sword that doesn't suck ass and doesn't become unviable after gettig literally any mech boss weapon.
This is a somewhat beta version that still needs a lot of work to be done.

Breaker Brade has received a damage buff.
Buster Sword is a Breaker Blade upgrade (requires some materials plus Broken Hero Sword).
Buster Sword has two attack modes, primary is a regular attack that shoots Blade Beam, secondary is a slower Braver that applies Broken Armor on hit.
When Buster Sword is held, player accumulates Limit on receiving damage (amount gained depends on damage received and maximum health). 
Fully accumulated Limit Break strengthens abilities: Blade Beam travels faster and pierces multiple enemies, Braver swings faster and unleashes a stronger attack on hit with 30-second Broken Armor debuff.

Most likely there will be more versions for hardmode tiers (pre-plantera, pre-moonlord, post-moonlord, etc.)
Additional feedback regarding balance is welcome on the github repo.
